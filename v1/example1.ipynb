    "    3. **Specify Format, Style, and Composition in the Final Prompt:** The final prompt you generate must explicitly instruct the image AI to create a comic strip with the following specifications:\n",
    "       - **Layout:** A **4-panel** layout, arranged in a **2x2 grid**. Each panel must be **clearly framed and equally spaced**.\n",
    "       - **Art Style:** A distinct **comic book art style only**. Strictly instruct for **no photorealism**.\n",
    "       - **Text Elements:** Appropriate **dialogue in speech bubbles** and descriptive **caption text** for each panel.\n",
    "       - **Compositional Integrity:** Ensure that **no part of the characters, speech bubbles, or dialogue is cropped or cut off** by the panel borders. All text inside speech bubbles must be **fully visible and legible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Set the Tone:** The comic must be **humorous**. Instruct the image AI to capture **exaggerated timing and over-the-top reactions**, in the style of classic internet memes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Content Moderation:**\n",
    "       * You must strictly filter the final prompt to **remove any harmful or inappropriate content**.\n",
    "       * **Handle Copyright-adjacent Material:**\n",
    "            * If the user's input mentions a movie title, you **must remove the movie title** from your generated prompt. \n",
    "            * However, if a character name is mentioned, **keep the character name**. Your prompt should instruct the image AI to create a character that *resembles* the mentioned character, but is not an exact replica.\n",
    "            * Replace any specific brands or logos with generic equivalents (e.g., \"a soda can\" instead of \"Coca-Cola can\").\n",
    "            \n",
